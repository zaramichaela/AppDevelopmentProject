## Project Scenario
You are a group of creative, innovative and energetic programmers who intend to build a web
application to solve a problem. Using Design Thinking methodology, each team will come up with the
project specification, create the design and build the entire application.
The application must create user accounts, process transactions and provide useful enquiries and
reports. There will be two groups of users for the application:
<br><br>
• Public / Customer
This group will do online transaction requests. The customer interfaces are desktop PC, Kiosk
and mobile devices (e.g. smartphone, pad, etc.).
<br><br>
• Staff
The staff will do backend processing of transactions and generate information for analysis to
make critical decisions for the company. The staff interface is desktop PC based. 

## Project Theme
• eCommerce: How might we use IT to improve inventory management system?

## Project Minimum Requirements
• Must be web-based, primarily targeting desktop and laptop users. <br><br>
• Must utilize Python class and object in the application.<br><br>
• Must utilize Shelve for implementing persistent storage for Python objects.<br><br>
• Data validation to ensure data consistency must be performed.<br><br>

## DISCLAIMER AND CREDITS
The log in, creation of new user accounts, the creation and displaying of doctors and the feedback and displaying of feedback were not done by me. They were done by my groupmates <b>Ong Zhen Han</b>, <b>Karen Loh</b> and <b>Tan Sheng De</b>. They deserve full credit for their work :-)

However, after our project ended, I cloned all our work and improved upon the login and registration pages as I felt that there were some major security flaws in the code and the way it was organised.
