## DISCLAIMER AND CREDITS
The log in, creation of new user accounts, the creation and displaying of doctors and the feedback and displaying of feedback were not done by me. They were done by my groupmates <b>Ong Zhen Han</b>, <b>Karen Loh</b> and <b>Tan Sheng De</b>. They deserve full credit for their work :-)

However, after our project ended, I cloned all our work and improved upon the login and registration pages as I felt that there were some major security flaws in the code and the way it was organised.
